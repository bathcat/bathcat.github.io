Every day.</li></ul></li></ul><blockquote><p>Judge not, that ye be not judged.<br/>
<!-- -->For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.<br/>
<!-- -->And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother&#x27;s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?<br/>
<!-- -->Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?<br/>
<!-- -->Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother&#x27;s eye.  </p></blockquote><p>Example: Ubuntu not booting because of a file not found in bashrc</p><p>Example: My stupid bank software</p><p>On expectations:</p><ul><li>It&#x27;s <em>possible</em> the user&#x27;s expectations are bogus<ul><li>ex: The person who thought he was rebooting his computer when in fact he just power-cycled the monitor</li></ul></li><li>But even then: good software is good communication, and good communication includes setting expectations</li></ul><h2>Qualifications</h2><p><em>Bad software</em> is a subjective term. So maybe the reason I see it everywhere say more about me than the world.</p><p><em>Bad software</em> is also a relative term. </p><h2>Reasons</h2><p>Bad software is everywhere because good software is hard. Good software is hard and rare in the same way that
good writing is hard and rare. It&#x27;s because good thinking is hard. It takes time, intelligence, honesty,
humility, empathy, deliberate practice, good taste, and hard work.</p><p>If we were to remove all bad writing, there wouldn&#x27;t be much to read. Abolishing bad thinking would destroy
the internet. Certainly it would destroy congress.</p><p>So take heart, if you&#x27;re an intern: skilled professionals with years of experience and big paychecks, they too
make bad software. Some habitually, but every one of them at least ocassionally.</p></div></main></div>
